[description of what secure coding means and how it is helpful and why it should be implemented companies/developers]
Static coding analysis
1.	Input validation – Be untrusting of user input, do not use dynamic SQL queries whenever possible use the accounts with the least number of privileges to deter unwanted access during a breech, put in place security workshops to ensure the staff is educated.
It is important to have the access resources controlled by the owner. Of course, HR must have access to create new accounts as well. Furthermore, having a central control directory access using lightweight directory access protocol is a must.

2.	Improper access control – Discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC), managed access control (MAC). There must be specification including but not limited to incorrect privileges, permissions, and ownership. When there are holes in the defenses, hackers and attackers can expose during a data breach.
All-in-all, the error and warning messages between VS Code and CPP Check are very different. Though, they mean the same in terms of how the program behaves. The error message “tok is never read” was not read by the VS Code interpreter but was read by the CPP Check extension. It is important to understand what both sets of mean so developers can apply iterative development with best practices. A risk within secure coding is cross-site scripting. Cross site scripting is when a vulnerability allows black hats to breech data to return malicious code inside the victim’s browser. 
The code returned many times will be in JavaScript. To mitigate this, developers must first, find and test the issues. Developers will manually test the codebase more specifically the Document Object Model (DOM) and implement unique identifiers in all entry points and or, wherever within the website the vulnerability. This shall eradicate any chance of an attack if done properly.
