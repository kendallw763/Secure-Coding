# Secure Coding


## Static coding analysis
### 1.	Input validation –

Be untrusting of user input, do not use dynamic SQL queries whenever possible, use the accounts with the least number of privileges to deter unwanted access during a breech, put in place security workshops to ensure the staff is educated.
It is important to have the access resources controlled by the owner. Of course, HR must have access to create new accounts as well. Furthermore, having a central control directory access using lightweight directory access protocol is a must.

### 2.	Improper access control –
  
Discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC), managed access control (MAC). There must be specification including but not limited to incorrect privileges, permissions, and ownership. When there are holes in the defenses, hackers and attackers can expose them during a data breach. The error and warning messages between VS Code and CPP Check are very different. Though, they mean the same in terms of how the program behaves.
   
   The error message “tok is never read” was not read by the VS Code interpreter but was read by the CPP Check extension. It is important to understand what both sets of messages mean so developers can apply iterative development with best practices and understanding. A risk within secure coding is cross-site scripting. Cross site scripting is when a vulnerability allows black hats to breech data to return malicious code inside the victim’s browser. 
   
   The code returned many times will be in JavaScript. To mitigate this, developers must first, find vulnerabilities and test them and the issues. Developers will manually test the codebase; To be more specific the Document Object Model (DOM) and implement unique identifiers in all entry points and or, wherever within the website the vulnerabilities lie. This shall eradicate any chance of an attack if and when done properly. 


## Secure coding best practices

 ### 1. Adoption of a secure coding standard, and not leaving security to the end
 
	Security should not be an afterthought. Preventing attacks must be done in advance through testing, researching the latest security trends and how teams can design and implement code to prevent against threats. This happens throughout the lifecycle whenever possible. Team members must have the attitude of protecting data, employee and customer information at the forefront of their minds. The prevention of vulnerabilities during the build of software products. 

### 2. Evaluation and assessment of risk and cost benefit of mitigation
Evaluation and assessment of risk can be completed through static coding analysis tools, research of common threats and vulnerabilities hackers tend to exploit companies and individuals for, lastly common developer logic errors created to prevent against specific attacks and vulnerabilities. Always test code for logical and functional errors. Code defects can happen up to deployment and afterwards. Preventing cyber-attacks and enhancing vulnerabilities means, practicing the best standards must always be a high priority. One may write a function to throw an exception, when necessary if an input exceeds 10 characters, the program will notify the developer. Some benefits of prevention include saved revenue, the safeguard of data, and company integrity. 

### 3. Zero trust
Zero Trust enforces the culture within companies to maintain an attitude towards safeguarding data, information of customers, and employees, also, physical items such as hard drives, or removeable drives. “Trust no” one will help in keep companies safe from unwanted data breeches or thievery through the internet, physical breeches such as penetration testers, or any unauthorized and unauthenticated person wanting to gain access to a restricted area. Weather over the internet or in person. We must keep the wrong people out. How we maintain this is by verifying everyone. 

### 4. Implementation and recommendations of security policies
The implementations of security policies are a must have to keep and ensure safety of company data, recourses, assets, stakeholder data, and of course, employee information. The recommendations of security policies are also another important use case within secure coding best practices. The reason behind this is to prevent attacks and vulnerabilities, developers and other team members must collaborate to ensure any weaknesses within the design infrastructure and code base are rectified. The weaknesses may include, defective code, bad naming conventions, uncommented code.

## Examples of what developers and engineers may encounter or use to maintain application security and prevent cyber attacks

SQL Injection - One of the most common way hackers such as black hat destroy a code base. Hackers use malicious code to within SQL statements through input forms on web pages
